title: 3D printing pictures
description: >-
  3D print pictures by converting them to lithophane models.
  There are online lithophane generators like 
  <a href="https://3dp.rocks/lithophane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>. 
  In the generator, always make the lithophane vertical and as positive image.
  For printing, use maximum line count (no infill), low speed (20 mm/s), and brim.
