title: Linux tablet (+ my own keyboard)
description: >-
  Custom tablet/laptop that (only) has a touchscreen so that I can use it to take notes and with my own custom keyboard.
  One option would be to have a nice set up at home and ssh/control it with a VPN.

difficulty: is it really worth it? what is a more convenient option?
