title: Whatsapp notes bot
description: >-
  I feel like I do not use Notes Apps because one needs to first think where to
  put the current note and this breaks the thought process of that note. 
  I prefer to first write the note and then classify where it should go.
  A bot could try to automatically classify the notes or ask you to which
  notes to append that information.
