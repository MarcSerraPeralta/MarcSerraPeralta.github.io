title: Density matrix simulator
description: >-
  Density matrix simulator that is a cleaner implementation of quantumsim.
  Seeing that the 'master' branch from quantumsim is very powerful, I will probably
  focus on contributing to quantumsim.

difficulty: it is a big project and maybe it is not useful as there are other simulators available (like quantumsim)
